# DetBogus: Fake News Detection System

## Overview

Welcome to **"DetBogus"**, an innovative Fake News Detection System. This project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for detecting fake news on social media platforms by integrating advanced techniques from blockchain technology, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity.

In today's digital age, the spread of fake news on social media is a pressing issue. Our approach leverages cutting-edge technologies to create a reliable detection system. This guide will walk you through the setup and running of our project.

## Project Highlights

- **Data Integrity**: Our database is stored on the Ethereum blockchain to ensure data integrity. The system validates the database at startup, detecting any tampering and halting operations until maintenance is performed.
- **Image Source Verification**: Using supervised learning trained with Roboflow, DetBogus identifies the source of news images (e.g., Samaa, Geo) by detecting logos.
- **Cross-Verification**: The system checks against up-to-date posts stored in IPFS to verify the authenticity of the image.
- **Text Extraction and Analysis**: Leveraging the OCR.space API, we extract text from images and apply NLP to sanitize it. Our ML model, trained on labeled news, predicts the authenticity of the news.
- **Outcome**: If the news is verified, it’s allowed to post; otherwise, it’s flagged as fake.
- **Social Media Integration**: We used the LinkedIn API as an example social media platform to demonstrate our system's capabilities.

## Technologies Used

- Ethereum Blockchain
- IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)
- Supervised Learning
- OCR.space API
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- LinkedIn API

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python installed on your system
- XAMPP installed
- IPFS Desktop installed
- Accounts on OCR.Space, Roboflow, and VirusTotal
- DevelopersLinkedin account

### 1. Install Python Libraries

Create a Python script named `install_libraries.py` with the provided code to install the required libraries.

Run the script with the following command:

```bash
python install_libraries.py
```

### 2. Install XAMPP and Replace `htdocs` Folder

Install XAMPP on your system. After installation, replace the default `htdocs` folder with the `htdocs` folder from our project repository.

### 3. Configure IPFS Desktop

- Install IPFS Desktop on your system.
- Create a folder named `Channels` in IPFS and upload the 6 News Channel folders into this folder.
- Copy the CID (Content Identifier) of the folders.

### 4. Configure OCR.Space

- Sign up for OCR.Space and get your API key.
- Paste the API key in the `api_key` variable in the `ocr_space_file()` function.

### 5. Train YOLOv9 Model on Roboflow

- Sign up for Roboflow.
- We have provided our own model API key in the project repository. However, you can also train a YOLOv10 model using the 6 News Channel folders provided in the repo.

### 6. Configure VirusTotal

- Sign up for VirusTotal and get your API key.
- Paste the API key in the appropriate location in the project code.

### 7. Configure LinkedIn API

- Create a DevelopersLinkedin account and create an application.
- Go to the Auth Section, copy the `Client_id` and `Primary Client Secret`, and save them.
- Create a Token and save it.
- Replace `APP_ID`, `APP_SECRET`, and `ACCESS_TOKEN` in the `Linkedin.php`, `init.php`, and `Callback1.php` files with your LinkedIn API credentials.

## Running the Project

After completing all the above steps, your project should be set up and ready to run. Follow any additional instructions specific to the project for running scripts or starting services.

### Additional Notes

- Ensure all API keys and credentials are kept secure and not exposed publicly.
- Follow best practices for managing dependencies and environment variables.

## Conclusion

By following this guide, you will have set up the necessary environment and configurations to run the project successfully. For any issues or further assistance, refer to the documentation of the respective services or contact the project maintainer.
